# HAVE-SHADOW
This repository will serve as the comprehensive code and data base for the HAVE SHADOW TMP as part of USAF TPS class 25A.

The SHADOW.py file contains the main script that converts raw flight test data to MOPs. The Utils folder contains scripts with data reduction functions, and the SHADOW.py folder utilizes these extensively.

 

The only required packages are numpy and pandas, so this should be able to run on a government laptop. 

Hit up Flash is anything breaks or you have any Qs!

INSTRUCTIONS:
1 - Save data in proper locations using the proper nomenclature:
# TODO - FILL THIS IN

2 - Press play on SHADOW.py with the following information on hand (the script will ask you to input this data)
# TODO - FILL THIS IN (pilot, flight #, scenarios, autonomy config, correct target acquisition, altitudes, ...)

3 - Ensure the MOPs.csv was saved to the output folder.

Done (for now) :)
